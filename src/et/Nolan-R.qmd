Effective teamwork is applicable to almost every aspect of life. Everybody works in a team at some point in their life. Team chemistry makes the experience more enjoyable and more effective. Team chemistry can be built by spending time doing bonding activities and building trust through experiences. Furthermore, communication about non-work related activities, experiences, and events can build a sense of family within a team. In addition to having great team chemistry, an effective team must have a sense of direction and a shared goal. Each group member should be aware of their own role in relation the greater goal and these roles should be assigned based on the personal strengths of team members. Team meetings should occur on a regular basis and must allow individuals to be creative. Team members should not complain or bring each other down because this hinder's the overall group performance and makes the process less enjoyable. In summary, it is most important to treat teammates with respect, share a common goal, and foster a positive-hardworking environment.
