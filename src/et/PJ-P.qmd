In the article “What Makes Teams Work?” Kirsten Weir explores the science behind effective teamwork and its significance across various industries, including healthcare, the military, academia, and business. Researchers have found that team success relies more on deep-level attributes, such as personality, values, and cognitive skills, rather than surface-level traits like age and gender. While innovation-driven teams benefit from diverse problem-solving abilities, efficiency-focused teams perform best when members share similar attitudes. Military research highlights the importance of both taskwork—what needs to be done—and teamwork—how members collaborate. A key factor in high-functioning teams is team cognition, which allows members to develop shared understanding and synchronized decision-making, particularly in high-pressure environments. In healthcare, effective teamwork is essential for improving patient outcomes, with strategies like multidisciplinary rounds and team huddles proving beneficial. However, systemic barriers, such as fee-for-service models and rigid hierarchies, often hinder collaboration in medical settings. In academic research, multidisciplinary collaborations offer solutions to complex problems but struggle with institutional reward systems that prioritize individual achievements over team contributions. Additionally, while multicultural teams foster innovation, they often face initial challenges due to differing communication styles and leadership expectations. Establishing hybrid team norms helps bridge these cultural gaps. Research also suggests that structured team training and clearly defined roles can enhance overall performance. Ultimately, Weir emphasizes that teamwork is not just an art but a science, and understanding the psychological principles behind it can lead to better outcomes across various fields.
